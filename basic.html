                <h3>1. How the cube works</h3>
                <p>
                    Before you start learning, it's useful to get an idea of how the cube really works. It's a common
                    misconception that you solve the cube one side at a time, but solving a side isn't actually useful
                    because the <b>pieces</b> that make up that side most likely won't be in the correct order. That's
                    why the cube is solved piece by piece, layer by layer. If you take a good look at a cube, you'll
                    notice that, for example, the three colors that make up a corner piece are inseparable, so it should
                    be treated as one piece instead of three colors.
                </p>

                <h3 id="notations">2. Notations</h3>
                <p>
                    It’s important to know how to read and perform written algorithms.<br><br>
                    <b>U (up)</b>: Rotate the top face<br>
                    <b>D (down)</b>: Rotate the bottom face<br>
                    <b>L (left)</b>: Rotate the left face<br>
                    <b>R (right)</b>: Rotate the right face<br>
                    <b>F (front)</b>: Rotate the front face<br>
                    <b>B (back)</b>: Rotate the back face<br>
                    <b>M (middle)</b>: Turn the middle layer of the cube (the layer that is the plane formed by the Y and Z axis);
                    a regular M move is clockwise from the left perspective (looking at the cube from the left)<br><br>
                    <b>x</b>: Rotate the whole cube along its X-axis<br>
                    <b>y</b>: Rotate the whole cube along its Y-axis<br>
                    <b>z</b>: Rotate the whole cube along its Z-axis<br>
                </p>
                Reading algorithms:
                <ul>
                    <li>If there is an apostrophe after a letter (ex. R’), it’s telling you to move that face
                        counterclockwise. Otherwise, just move it clockwise.</li>
                    <li>If there is a 2 after a letter (ex. R2), it’s telling you to move that face twice (180 degrees).
                    </li>
                    <li>If a letter is lowercased, you need to rotate two layers. (ex. f means rotate the front two
                        layers clockwise.)</li>
                    <li>You will sometimes find certain sets of moves enclosed by parentheses. These parentheses don’t
                        mean anything; they are just supposed to make it easier for you to read algorithms by separating
                        them into different parts.</li>
                    <li>If there is a number after parentheses with moves inside them (ex. (R U R’ U’)3), it’s
                        telling you to repeat what is inside of the parentheses that many times.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <h3 id="algorithms">3. Algorithms</h3>
                <p>
                    An algorithm is a sequence of moves. If you're a beginner and trying to memorize algorithms, I
                    recommend you do the moves and once you get the muscle memory down, keep doing the algorithm and
                    watch what happens to the cube. Then you can remember it like that. Here are two easy and essential
                    algorithms you’ll need to memorize to solve the cube:
                <ul>
                    <li>Right-hand algorithm: <b>R U R’ U’</b></li>
                    <li>Left-hand algorithm: <b>L’ U’ L U</b></li>
                </ul>
