            <h2>The beginner method is an easy, intuitive way to solve the cube. It is not meant to get fast times, but
                is the best way to start learning.</h2>

                            The first step to solve a 3x3 cube is to make the "daisy," or "lily". This means having
                            the yellow center completely surrounded by white edges (the corner pieces don’t matter.)
                            There is no algorithm to achieve this; you just figure this out on your own.
                            <br><br>
                            If you're stuck, try:

                                <li>Placing the white edges next to the yellow center one by one.</li>
                                <li>If the piece you’re trying to place is not yet next to the yellow center, a good way
                                    to start is by moving it to the middle layer of the cube (holding the yellow center
                                    on top).

                            this process for all four white edge pieces. In the end, you should have the white cross,

                            other than white) with U moves. Here's an example of what this might look like:

                            4. Repeat this process until all four white corners are in. In the end, you should have

                            2. Rotate the top to move it away from where it needs go to. For example, if you were moving

                            the left-hand algorithm. If the
